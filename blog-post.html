<h2>The Problem: Windows-Only BIOS Updates on a Linux AI Workstation</h2>

<p>The <strong>Minisforum MS-S1 Max</strong> has quickly become one of the most popular mini PCs for AI workloads, local LLM inference, and Linux-based homelabs. With its AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 processor (16 cores, 32 threads of Zen 5), 128 GB of LPDDR5X-8000 memory, and a Radeon 8060S GPU capable of sharing up to 96 GB of that memory as VRAM, it's a serious machine for running models like Llama, Mistral, and DeepSeek locally.</p>

<p>But there's a catch. When Minisforum releases a BIOS update — and you should install them for stability, security patches, and performance improvements — they only provide Windows-based tools. If you're running NixOS, Ubuntu, Arch, or any other Linux distribution, you're seemingly out of luck.</p>

<p>Except you're not. Here's how we update the BIOS on our MS-S1 Max fleet without ever touching Windows.</p>

<h2>What You Need</h2>

<ul>
<li>A USB flash drive (512 MB or larger — any old stick will do)</li>
<li>A Linux machine to prepare the USB</li>
<li>The official BIOS update file from <a href="https://www.minisforum.com/pages/product-info" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minisforum's support page</a></li>
<li>About 15 minutes of your time</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Secret: EFI Shell Is Already Built In</h2>

<p>Here's what most guides miss: Minisforum's BIOS packages already include everything you need to flash from an EFI Shell. Inside the download you'll find <code>AfuEfix64.efi</code> (AMI's EFI-native firmware update utility) and <code>EfiFlash.nsh</code> (a shell script that automates the flash). These are native UEFI applications — they run before any operating system loads and have direct hardware access to the SPI flash chip. No Windows. No Linux. No OS at all.</p>

<p>Modern UEFI firmware includes a built-in command-line environment called the EFI Shell. Think of it as a minimal operating system baked into your motherboard. It can read FAT32 USB drives, execute EFI applications, and run scripts. That's all we need.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Prepare the USB Drive on Linux</h2>

<p>We've published an <a href="https://github.com/capetron/minisforum-ms-s1-max-bios" target="_blank" rel="noopener">automated script on GitHub</a> that handles everything in one command, but here's the manual process:</p>

<p>First, download the BIOS update and a UEFI Shell binary:</p>

<pre><code>wget -O SHWSA_1.06.7z "https://pc-file.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/MS-S1+MAX/BIOS/SHWSA_1.06_260104B.7z"
wget -O shellx64.efi "https://github.com/pbatard/UEFI-Shell/releases/download/24H2/ShellX64.efi"</code></pre>

<p>Then partition your USB as a single FAT32 EFI System Partition and copy the files:</p>

<pre><code># Replace /dev/sdX with your USB device (check with lsblk)
sudo sgdisk --zap-all /dev/sdX
sudo sgdisk -a1 -n1:0:0 -c 1:efiboot -t1:EF00 /dev/sdX
sudo mkfs.vfat -F32 -n "BIOS" /dev/sdX1

sudo mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt
7z x SHWSA_1.06.7z -o/tmp/bios/
sudo cp /tmp/bios/SHWSA_1.06_260104B/{AfuEfix64.efi,EfiFlash.nsh,SHWSA.BIN} /mnt/
sudo cp shellx64.efi /mnt/
sudo umount /mnt</code></pre>

<p>You should end up with four files on the USB: <code>shellx64.efi</code>, <code>AfuEfix64.efi</code>, <code>EfiFlash.nsh</code>, and <code>SHWSA.BIN</code>.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Boot into EFI Shell on the MS-S1 Max</h2>

<p>Plug the USB into your MS-S1 Max and power on. Press <strong>Del</strong> repeatedly to enter BIOS Setup. Before you can use the EFI Shell, you'll need to <strong>disable Secure Boot</strong> — navigate to the Security menu, and you may need to set an Administrator password first to unlock the option.</p>

<p>Once Secure Boot is disabled, look for "UEFI Shell" or "Launch EFI Shell from filesystem device" in the boot menu. If it's not listed, you can add a boot entry pointing to <code>shellx64.efi</code> on the USB drive.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Flash the BIOS</h2>

<p>At the <code>Shell&gt;</code> prompt, find your USB drive and run the flash script:</p>

<pre><code>FS0:
dir
EfiFlash.nsh</code></pre>

<p>If <code>FS0:</code> doesn't show your files, try <code>FS1:</code>, <code>FS2:</code>, and so on. The script calls AMI's flash utility with the appropriate flags to program the main BIOS area, boot block, and NVRAM while preserving your SMBIOS data and security keys.</p>

<p>The system will automatically shut down or reboot once the flash is complete.</p>

<h2>Step 4: First Boot — Don't Panic</h2>

<p>This is where many people get nervous. The first boot after a BIOS update can take <strong>5 to 10 minutes</strong> while the system performs memory training — recharacterizing all 128 GB of LPDDR5X to ensure stability at 8000 MT/s. You may see a black screen, the power LED cycling, or several reboots. This is completely normal.</p>

<p>Once it boots, all BIOS settings will be reset to defaults. Re-enter the BIOS (Del key) to verify the new version, re-enable Secure Boot if desired, and check your boot order. Your NixOS, Ubuntu, or other Linux installation should still be there — the boot entries are stored in NVRAM, which survives BIOS updates.</p>

<h2>Why Keep Your BIOS Updated?</h2>

<p>For an AI workstation like the MS-S1 Max, BIOS updates are especially important:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Memory stability:</strong> The Ryzen AI Max+ 395 pushes 128 GB of LPDDR5X at 8000 MT/s. BIOS updates improve memory controller tuning, reducing errors during sustained AI training and inference workloads.</li>
<li><strong>NPU and GPU performance:</strong> AMD's 50 TOPS NPU and Radeon 8060S iGPU get firmware-level optimizations that improve AI acceleration frameworks like ROCm and ONNX Runtime.</li>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> Platform Security Processor (PSP) patches address vulnerabilities in the AMD secure enclave — critical if your workstation handles sensitive data or client models.</li>
<li><strong>USB4 V2 and PCIe:</strong> The MS-S1 Max's USB4 V2 ports (80 Gbps) and PCIe x16 slot benefit from controller firmware fixes that improve external GPU and NVMe performance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Automate It with Our Script</h2>

<p>We've packaged this entire process into a single script that handles downloading, partitioning, and file copying. It includes safety checks to prevent you from accidentally wiping the wrong drive:</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/capetron/minisforum-ms-s1-max-bios.git
cd minisforum-ms-s1-max-bios
sudo ./scripts/prep-usb.sh /dev/sdX</code></pre>
